Histogram Equilization

#Defination:
	Histogram equalization is a technique for adjusting image intensities to enhance contrast. 
While it is straightforward for grayscale images, applying it to color images requires additional 
considerations to avoid color distortion

#Steps for Histogram Equalization on a Color Image:
1. Convert the Color Space:
	* Convert the image from RGB to a color space that separates intensity from color information, 
	  such as the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) or YCbCr (Luminance, Chrominance) color space.
	* For HSV, you would equalize the V (value) channel.
	* For YCbCr, you would equalize the Y (luminance) channel.

2. Equalize the Intensity Channel:
	* Apply histogram equalization to the intensity component (V in HSV, Y in YCbCr).

3. Convert Back to RGB:
	* Combine the equalized intensity channel with the original color channels 
	  (H and S in HSV, Cb and Cr in YCbCr).
	* Convert the image back to the RGB color space.
